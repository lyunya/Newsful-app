# Newsful

### This app was developed to help you see how news sources from all sides of the political spectrum report on what's going on in the world.

## Description
#### As we increasingly get our news from digital media sources, it is important to be aware of the role that bias plays in what we're reading. I know for myself and many others, we tend to only read news from sources that align with where we are on the political spectrum. I created this app that shows you how stories are reported on across conservative, liberal, and neutral news outlets. This will show how stories are reported on from different viewpoints.

## Functionality

* Create new accounts and log in with those credentials
